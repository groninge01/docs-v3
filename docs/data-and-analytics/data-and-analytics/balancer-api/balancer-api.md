# Balancer API
Balancer's API exposes data on Balancer's smart contracts accessible via graphql. The API is running as a graphql server and is deployed at [https://api-v3.balancer.fi](https://api-v3.balancer.fi).

:::info Want to keep up with changes to the API?
You can subscribe to the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/BalBeetsApi) or check out the [repo](https://github.com/balancer/backend) stay updated.

Queries are organized around these main domains:

- Pools
- Gauges
- Events
- Users
- Tokens
- Prices
- SOR (Smart Order Router used for swaps)

One of the conventions is to use "dynamicData" for querying changing parts of the state.

Further documentation is available on the self documented [api server](https://api-v3.balancer.fi).
